Description:
My personal test script for InfinityScript 1.5 functions and new ideas. It contains a plethora or functions from giving weapons to playing effects to dumping/modifying entities on the map. There is quite a bit of stuff in this script. It is all meant for testing, so a lot of this is not meant to be in a public server.
